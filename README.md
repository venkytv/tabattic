##### A bare-bones implementation of Chrome's OneTab extension for Safari

Failed to find a Safari equivalent of Chrome's fantastic
(OneTab)[http://www.one-tab.com] extension,
decided to learn how Safari's extensions worked, and put this together.

My JavaScript knowledge is almost nonexistent.  I'm sure this could have been
written much cleaner by someone with more than a passing familiarity with it.
But this serves my purpose for the moment.

Right now, there is no way to remove a saved tabs from the list.  Will get to
that someday.
